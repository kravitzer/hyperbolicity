	 * @brief	Abstract implementation for a single-double-sweep with minimum distance: It performs a single double sweep
	 *			to obtain the first 2 nodes. Then it runs on the entire graph, looking for a third node according to the 
	 *			candidates selected by the derived class' implementation (based on its distances from v1 and v2). After
	 *			choosing one of the candidates randomly, it simply goes over all nodes one more time, selecting the node
	 *			that produces the maximal delta hyperbolicity value (at this point we already have all the distances from v1, v2, v3).
	 *
	 *			This implementation also remembers the last p Double-Sweeps (p is a parameter) and at each step (after the p'th step):
	 *			For each node that appeard in at least q (also a parameter) of the Double-Sweeps, try to see if it is a part of a cycle and
	 *			remove it if possible.
